## Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide a source code ff two popular wireless technologies, LoRa and 802.11s, within the domain of wireless smart grids. These technologies have gained significant attention due to their suitability for wide-area networks (LoRa) and mesh networking capabilities (802.11s).

## Features

- Modification of LoRa implementation from https://github.com/signetlabdei/lorawan.
- Modification of simulation parameters of 802.11s modules in the context of smart grids.


## Installation

To use the modules in this repository, you need import these modules into your ns-3 project:
