## Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of two popular wireless technologies, LoRa and 802.11s, within the domain of wireless smart grids. These technologies have gained significant attention due to their suitability for low-power, wide-area networks (LoRa) and mesh networking capabilities (802.11s).

## Features

- Implementation of LoRa and 802.11s modules
- Comparison of network coverage, data rate, and power consumption
- Performance evaluation in the context of wireless smart grids
- Sample datasets and simulations for testing and analysis
